    <h2>You should replace this page with your own web pages as soon as possible.</h2>
    Unless you changed its configuration, your new server is configured as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration files can be found in <span class="tt">/etc/lighttpd</span>. Please read  <span class="tt">/etc/lighttpd/conf-available/README</span> file.</li>
      <li>The DocumentRoot, which is the directory under which all your HTML files should exist, is set to <span class="tt">/var/www/html</span>.</li>
      <li>CGI scripts are looked for in <span class="tt">/usr/lib/cgi-bin</span>, which is where Ubuntu packages will place their scripts. You can enable cgi module by using command <span class="bold tt">&quot;lighty-enable-mod cgi&quot;</span>.</li>
      <li>Log files are placed in <span class="tt">/var/log/lighttpd</span>, and will be rotated weekly. The frequency of rotation can be easily changed by editing <span class="tt">/etc/logrotate.d/lighttpd</span>.</li>
      <li>The default directory index is <span class="tt">index.html</span>, meaning that requests for a directory <span class="tt">/foo/bar/</span> will give the contents of the file /var/www/html/foo/bar/index.html if it exists (assuming that <span class="tt">/var/www/html</span> is your DocumentRoot).</li>
      <li>You can enable user directories by using command <span class="bold tt">&quot;lighty-enable-mod userdir&quot;</span></li>
    </ul>
